A business side admin dashboard for businesses to manage available appointment times and future appointments.
A customer interface where customers can schedule, view, or cancel their appointments with a business.
Use the simplest scheduler (cron job) to send customers email reminders prior to their appointments.

Create a report where businesses can view the scheduled appointments.

Allow customers to view and edit their appointments (e.g. reschedule or cancel).

Allow businesses to change the status of the event (e.g. confirmed, paid, cancelled).
